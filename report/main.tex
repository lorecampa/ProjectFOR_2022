\section{Problem}

This problem can be modeled as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem, where we need to decide which 
farms to locate the plants at and which farms to assign to each plant as suppliers.

Let's define the following variables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x_i$: binary variable that is 1 if a plant is located at farm $i$ and 0 otherwise.
    \item  $y_{i,j}$: binary variable that is 1 if farm $j$ supplies corn chopping to farm $i$ and 0 otherwise.
    \item  $z_{i,j}$: binary variable that is 1 if farm $j$ supplies corn chopping to farm $i$ and 0 otherwise.

\end{itemize}

The objective function is to maximize the total revenues of the association, which is the sum of the revenues from each plant. The revenue from each plant is equal to the energy produced by the plant multiplied by the unitary price of energy. The energy produced by each plant is equal to the sum of the energy produced by each ton of corn chopping burned, multiplied by the number of tons of corn chopping burned.

Therefore, the objective function can be written as:

$$\text{maximize} \sum_{i=1}^n Q \cdot b \cdot x_i \cdot \sum_{j=1}^n y_{i,j} \cdot a_j$$

We need to add constraints to ensure that each farm can 
only be assigned to at most one plant, and that each farm can only supply corn chopping to at most one plant. We can add these constraints as follows:

$$\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \leq p$$

$$\sum_{i=1}^n y_{i,j} \leq 1 \quad \forall j$$

$$\sum_{j=1}^n y_{i,j} \leq 1 \quad \forall i$$

We also need to ensure that the percentage of dry matter of the corn chopping burned at each plant is within the required range. We can add this constraint as follows:

$$k_{min} \leq \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n y_{i,j} \cdot a_j}{\sum_{j=1}^n y_{i,j}} \leq k_{max} \quad \forall i$$

Finally, we need to ensure that each plant does not produce more than the maximum allowed amount of energy. We can add this constraint as follows:

$$\sum_{j=1}^n y_{i,j} \cdot Q \leq M \quad \forall i$$

This MILP can be solved using an off-the-shelf MILP solver, such as Gurobi or CPLEX. The solution will give us the optimal placement and assignment of the plants and the corn chopping suppliers.
